# me4242_grp1
Code submission for ME4242 final project

This codebase is used to control a pneumatically actuated fishbot via Bluetooth.
With the Arduino code uploaded, run 'fishbot.py' to connect to HC-06 module.

Note that bluetooth_port at line 10 needs to be updated to the correct COM port for connection to be established.
COM port can be found in 'More Bluetooth options/COM Port' in the Bluetooth settings.
Choose the Outgoing COM port for HC-06.
*note the this is only applicable for Windows

To run a mockup of the GUI without control functionalities, run the 'run_gui.py' file.
